## Build project: ( Linux )

#### To build and run your program, follow these steps:
- Inside all-targets/compiler
- Create a build directory (e.g., `mkdir build`).
- Change to the build directory (e.g., `cd build`).
- Run CMake to generate the build files: `cmake ..`
- Build your program using your preferred build command (e.g., `make`).
- Execute the custom target "run" to run your program: `make run`.

## Testing

#### To build and run your tests, follow these steps:

- Inside all-targets/tests
- Create a build directory (e.g., `mkdir test-build`).
- Change to the build directory (e.g., `cd test-build`).
- Run CMake to generate the build files: `cmake ..`
- Run your tests using your preferred build command (e.g., `make`).
