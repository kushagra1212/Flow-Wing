## Build project:

#### To build and run your program, follow these steps:

- Create a build directory (e.g., ```mkdir build```).
- Change to the build directory (e.g., ```cd build```).
- Run CMake to generate the build files: ```cmake ..```
- Build your program using your preferred build command (e.g., ```make```).
- Execute the custom target "run" to run your program: ```make run```.
